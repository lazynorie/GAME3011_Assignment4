This is a 2077's hacking mini game clone we made for assignment4. 

For this project, there are rows and columns in the grid, and the way to hack it is to find the numbers in the grid to complete the sequence.

In this project, there are three difficulties you can choose from in the main menu. 
EASY NORMAL and HARD:
EASY: 7X5 grid, 5 different numbers in the sequence
NORMAL: 6X5 grid, 6 different numbers in the sequence 
HARD: 5X5 grid, 7 different numbers in the sequence

To ensure the player wouldn't get soft locked, we forced a solution into the grid.

The score displayed at the winning scene reflects the skill level of the player. So it basically takes the remaining timer and divides it by 30, and takes the % as the player score. Which means a player can get a score between 0 to 100.
